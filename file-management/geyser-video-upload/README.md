# Geyser Video Upload v1.1

## What does it do?
* Splits folders with video assets into ZIP archives with 40 files per ZIP.
* Made for video uploads to Geyser, but can be used with any files.

## How do I run it?
* Click [here](/file-management/geyser-video-upload/exe/geyser-video-upload.exe) and download the file into the folder containing subfolders with video assets (e.g. `video_1`, `video_2` etc.).
* Double click the file to run it.
* You will see a bunch of ZIP archives starting to appear.
* Wait until the console window closes and don't close it yourself.

# What's new in 1.1?
* Fixed a bug where the script was overwriting its own ZIP files.
